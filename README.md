Overview
The Expense Tracker is a simple Python command-line application designed to help users track their expenses and manage their budget. Users can input their expenses, categorize them, and monitor their spending relative to a specified budget. The application saves the entered expenses to a CSV file for persistent storage.

Features
Expense Entry: Users can input details for a new expense, including the expense name, amount, and category.

Expense Categories: Expenses can be categorized into predefined categories such as Food, Home, Work, Fun, and Misc.

File Persistence: All entered expenses are saved to a CSV file (expenses.csv by default) to maintain a record of past expenses.

Budget Monitoring: The application calculates and displays a summary of expenses, including total spent, remaining budget, and a breakdown of expenses by category.

Daily Budget: The application calculates and displays the remaining budget per day based on the current date and the end of the month.
